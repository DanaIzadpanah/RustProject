Description: regrep 

Rust-Grep (rgrep) is a fast, reliable, and feature-rich command-line tool written in Rust to search for patterns in files and directories. Inspired by the Unix grep command, rgrep allows you to search for regular expressions, traverse directories recursively, perform case-insensitive searches, and display line numbers for matched results.
